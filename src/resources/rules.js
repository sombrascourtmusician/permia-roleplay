Do not be inflammatory, troll, or grief players. This includes stabs based on race, gender, sex, or orientation. None of this will be tolerated on sim or in the discord.",

Especially when it involves any questionable actions towards them such as; a character’s death, maiming, sex, capture, etc. If they wish to not participate in such scenarios, please show the necessary respect. Keep in mind, in-character actions should have in-character consequences. Consent may overrule any rule, excluding Second Life / Linden Labs ToS, [1] General Rules, and [5] Discord Rules.",
  "Combat is also consent based. One may freeform roleplay combat if both parties agree to it. If even one disagrees, the HUD is the fallback."

  "No Godmodding – You may not control another player’s actions or control another’s player’s reaction to your posts. An example of this would be making a post such as:<div class='mx-4 border p-2'>Pisque cuts off Mira’s arm and proceeds to beat her with it!</div>Instead, provide the option to the player:<div class='mx-4 border p-2'>Pisque TRIES to cut off Mira’s arm and WOULD ATTEMPT to beat her with it!</div>",
  "No Powergaming – You may not create a god, godlike character, or an all-powerful being that has little to no weaknesses.",

  "Please have your avatar be within the server’s medieval fantasy theme. 16th / 17th Century firearms are allowed within Permia. You may not have anything that’s from the modern / future era. Otherwise, the only limitations are that your avatar is not against linden rules.",

If you want to do a character transfer, that can be arranged through an admin.",

const combatRules = [
  "All combat is consent based. If a character is instigating combat and says they don't consent to it, then they are avoiding consequences and an admin should be reached out to. Combat can also be freeformed as long as both parties agree to it. If a single party does not consent to freeform, then the HUD should be used as the default.",
  "Combat begins when two or more parties roll initiative. Combat is taken in turns, with the highest roll starting combat, and the lower roll going next. In team combats, the initiative process will be done in a round robin format. For example: Team 1's rolls: 103, 96, 82. Team 2's rolls: 66, 42, 30. The order would be Team 1's Highest (103) > Team 2's Highest (66) > Team 1's Second Highest (96) > Team 2's Second Highest (42) and so on. When the lowest roll has completed their turn, it loops back around to the first player once more. Please try to keep combat ratios equal 1v1, 2v2, etc unless consent is given. But once initiative is rolled, bystanders may no longer join in unless all participating parties agree.",
  "Before combat starts, in the initiative phase, any player may roll to escape. This does NOT count as your escape/other check during combat. Furthermore, buffing or disguising/revealing when it's clear that combat is about to start is also against the rules.",
  "During faction defense or when one player is acting aggressively, combat fairness (keeping fights in equal numbers on each side) may be waived. The player that is starting the fight loses their right to combat fairness and the defender can bring in their immediate friends as help. However, finding equivalent combat for each side, especially in faction conflict that can drive a story, should be priority. If there can be a 3v3 fight instead of 3 different 1v3s, you should go for that.",
  "Faction defense further expands on this as any player starting trouble in faction territory forfeits combat fairness against the members of said faction. An example: breaking the law in Sarkada means the Houses of Sarkada can fight you in an unfair way.",
  "The winner of the fight earns the right to a reward. This can range from capturing the player to put them in jail, monetary compensation, and anything else the victor can think of. This does, however, rely on consent from both sides. Extreme consequences like rape, dismemberment, death, and other such things must be consented to as well.",
  "If no consequence can be agreed upon by the victor and the loser of the fight, contact an admin to resolve the situation.",
  "Checks such as Overwhelm and Outlast can only be used once per fight. Escape can be used three times.",
  "In capture RP, you may leave once your captor is done with the roleplay. The captor can also not hold you for over an hour unless you consent to it.",
  "In case of ties, where both players reach 0 health points in the same turn, the winner is determined in the following order: if in faction territory, the defending faction wins. Otherwise, the player that attacked last wins the fight."
