  "Permia has two moons - the larger one is named Mah meaning ‘the fortunate lady’, and is quite similar to an Earth-like moon. It appears dominantly in the sky, taking up a bit more of the sky than an Earth full moon. The second moon is close to the same size but further away so it seems smaller. It’s also covered in dust from an impact millenia ago, giving it a strange, purple hue. It’s referred to as Lah meaning ‘the malicious man’ and is considered a cursed moon because of its color.",
  "In addition to Permia, there’s four other planets in the system, though only two can be seen. The first is roughly Permia sized and appears as a small orange dot in the sky. The other is much larger but further away, and can be seen on particularly clear days as a blue and green, marble sized spot in the stars.",

  "These are in development and not set in stone. If you have some you want to add, feel free to ping an admin!",

const shasuReligion = [
  "Sarkada doesn’t have an official religion per say. There are several different cults and sects throughout the city and the Hold, the largest of which being the Cult of Mah.",
  "It focuses on the worship of the moons, with the main centered belief being that Mah granted Permia life and watches over everyone. The followers pray to Mah, generally asking for her fortitude and her grace in trying times. There are sacrifices as well, though not of the human variety but animal instead, or even flora. One of the most popular ceremonies is taking peacock feathers and hyacinth petals and burning them as an offering to the Goddess. There are also different rituals that are used to bless individuals - usually noble children - by taking some of Mah’s power.",
  "It’s undeniable that there is a goddess there. One, with particularly strong magic, can talk to her. She does, however, see the people of Permia as nothing more than a bother, with the constant demands for attention and power more annoying than anything else. Those who do talk to her talk about an irritated, busy woman that doesn’t want anything to do with the people of Permia. And yet, people worship her nonetheless. Strange.",
  "The other religions are lesser and spread out, with none of them being particularly popular at the moment. Mah and the others are present in both the Silver Hold and Sarkada, as a religion of the Shasu.",

const housesOfSarkada = [
  "There are four major Houses and an innumerable number of minor ones. Players can join the major factions but will need to follow a rubric for how their character is set up. Alternatively, they can make a minor House at any time and it’s fairly free form so long as they’re Persian themed and fit the sim’s theme.",
  "<h2>The Major Houses</h2>",
  "<h3>Amani</h3>",
  "The Amani House primarily involves themselves within magic study, both for inventions and progress as well as for war, and the Court system. They are decently involved within the army as well, their magical prowess making them strong warriors. The previous Amani patriarch, recently deceased, was the leader of the Highest Court in the land, the position remaining open to this day. Their colors are purple and blue, much like the crest of Sarkada itself, and their numbers are seemingly split dead even on those focusing on justice and the courts, and those focusing on different branches of magic.",
  "<h3>Parthia</h3>",
  "The Parthia House is the current ruling House in Sarkada. Their line has ruled since the beginning, with the first King Gilgamesh founding Sarkada along with the other Houses. Nowadays, King Xerses Parthia is the current sitter on the throne, widowed decades ago. He is aging, over eighty years old, which means that the throne has a current succession crisis. Aida is the next Parthian in line, but as she’s a rebel there is no clear line. This has left Amani as the second most prominent House snipping at their heels. In addition to ruling, the Parthian line has strong military traditions as commanders, and their colors are a classic black and gold pairing.",
  "<h3>Zare</h3>",
  "The dominant merchant House, Zare deals in all different sectors. There isn’t a good in Sarkada that hasn’t been touched by a Zare merchant at least once. There are other Houses competing for the spot, but none have even come close to challenging the dominance of the merchants of Zare. Additionally, Zare raises horses and has the best stock you can get around the desert. Their colors are red and yellow, and you’ll see them in the market consistently dealing their wares.",
  "<h3>Mirzaei</h3>",
  "Mirzaei and Zare work really closely together, with Mirzaei crafting the goods that Zare sells. Each of their people from near birth choose a craft to specialize in and devote to it for their entire life. As such, they craft extraordinary wares, outstanding works of art, the best clothes you can find. They work closely with the other Houses, using Amani’s magical expertise for some things and Zare to make sure their wares are moved for a fair price. Silver and blue are their colors, which has had them be mistaken for the Silver Hold.",

const oldBoughs = [
  "The druids of the Old Boughs have been around longer than anyone can really count. Their oral histories place them around six hundred years old.",
  "They weren’t originally a mountainous tribe. When they first came to what is now known as Permia, they too lived in the valley. Once upon a time, it was a lush paradise, with trees and water galore. Many different types of animals called the valley home, as it was nearly predator free at the time and most herbivorous. The Old Boughs lived in the valley during this time, quietly and peacefully minding their own business.",
  "Many of their current rituals stem from this time, and the crystals were seen as a fairly positive thing at the time. They were involved in what the Boughs did, using them to spread the greenery further and further from the valley. The desert around the valley started to change from this work, slowly but steadily and the Old Boughs thrived with it.",
  "But something happened, something that the Boughs haven’t figured out to this day. The crystals turned into defoliators, poison instead of the wondrous creations they’d been before. The druids retreated along with the forest, the land dying around them as they went further and further up the mountain, finally settling into where they live today.",
  "There are rumors still. Rumors that the Boughs were the one who caused the disaster of the canyon. Other rumors say that they’re in possession of the last, pure, uncorrupted crystal that exists, the only one that doesn’t afflict people.",
  "But rumors are just rumors, aren’t they?",

const governments = [
  "Sarkada is a true absolute monarchy. While the nobles have power of their own in the fact that they have land and money, the king - or queen - makes all the decisions at the end of the day. To facilitate this, there are many bureaucrats helping scribe the king’s thoughts, or writing laws to make his words take effect. The throne passes via direct succession, father to daughter or so. They make no distinction on gender in terms of succession, as a daughter or a son are both equally as accepted.",
  "The Silver Hold, on the other hand, is a constitutional monarchy. Princess Aida still holds most of the power, but there is a council of twelve that helps her rule. She is also bound to a constitution that limits what she can do on her own, and a lot of it requires the approval of the council of twelve. Nevertheless, she’s still an important figurehead, and most of what she wants or commands passes without an issue."

const cuali = [
  "The Cuali were the ones who lived in the jungle before the Black Horde arrived. They lived centuries ago, creating impressive magical creations, living in harmony with the crystals around them.",
  "Magic permeated every part of their lives, their arts, their work. They were advanced enough to have ample leisure time, with every member of their society being schooled, learned, and having their own hobbies and lives outside of their work. The ziggurats and ritual sites they built were for things to improve their society - water filtering, farm land clearing, things of that nature.",
  "At some point, one of their members turned traitor. Something went wrong with their magic and the crystals they touched changed, darkening from a brilliant blue to the purple and orange one might see today, drained or corrupted or both. This traitor would amass enough power to be the end of the Cuali people. Despite all their wondrous creations, their powerful magic, the first Afflicted - no, the first Corrupted - would be their end.",

const treatmentOfAffliction = [
  "Affliction in general is not curable. There isn’t a way to actually remove it from someone as it’s both a disease of the body and the soul. There are a few work arounds like the Houses doll project, but they all require great sacrifices of body and soul both, and usually end with the person worse off than they were before.",
  "That being said, there are an innumerable amount of ways to treat affliction. Potions, rituals, and even diet can influence how badly affliction hinders an individual. OOCly, these are able to be done by nearly anyone, though cures have to be cleared first and will usually be denied as it’s a core tenet of the conflict.",
];

const magic = [
  "Magic is generally in the world around you. It can come from two sources - those with magic born within them can bring it from within themselves, or ungifted can learn other ways, drawing from other power sources such as the crystals, ambient life around them, focuses like necromantic fetishes and so on.",
  "Magic, once gathered from a power, then has to be focused and used, channeled. There are two main types of casters - runic ones and instinct ones. Runic casters channel their work through runes, pushing magic through them either by writing it down or creating them out of magic in the air. Generally, this type of magic has more control than any other, letting the users get exactly what they want out of magic.",
  "Instinct casters, however, use their instincts and feelings to channel their power. This can sometimes lead to great things, huge works of magic, stuff that can accomplish things no other can. But it can be unpredictable as well, it can make mistakes, backfire on the user.",
  "It is generally the belief of the Academy that one should study their runes as much as possible and use that, as being an instinct caster is a risk to becoming afflicted - or so they believe.",
