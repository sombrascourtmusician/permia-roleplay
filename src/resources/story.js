  "Long ago, the Shasu people were nomads. They eked out a harsh existence among the unending desert sands. It was a tough and strict livelihood, but a fair and honorable one, a rewarding one.",
  "Guided by the great hero Sarka, they found a place that didn’t change: An oasis with an abundance all year round, one that was somehow fertile enough to grow crops in too! They, naturally, settled around this, setting up their tents and celebrating day and night as their luck had turned around.",
  "Over time, the tribe grew. Outsiders came and saw how well the land took care of the people and joined with them.. It started as a small village, then a town, and soon Sarkada grew into a grand city. Walls for defense, a magnificent palace for the founding family, things were truly beautiful.",
  "But they weren’t perfect, the city had stretched the limit of what the oasis could provide. People started to go hungry, and having land around the oasis became more and more valuable. The ones who owned it were given status because they produced the food, elevated beyond simple farmers. Crime, slowly, started to rise: thievery, murder, even darker things that one dare not mention lest it becomes reality.",
  "The ruling family, now royalty, were split on a solution. It had reached a breaking point, enough that a response was required from the royals. Some of them wanted to keep laws lax and add more support structures around the city, something to help these poor souls get out of their hardship. Others wanted to strengthen the laws and make it all the more severe if one got caught.",
  "As it happens with such politics, a fight broke out. Not a true civil war, but a quiet rebellion, a coup designed to usurp power and take it over finally. It was swift, it was decisive, and within the span of a single week, King Gilgamesh had managed to wrest control of the land from the rest of the royal family in a violent coup led by the Houses of Sarkada.",
  "The remnants of the rebellion fled, the court ravaged, and quite a few of the royal family fled along with their courtiers and their followers. They fled from the desert entirely, a journey fraught with hardship and suffering. But somehow, through some miracle they escaped their pursuers, survived the wilderness into the mountains where they could survive and regrow.",
  "Both sides grew over time, the city’s strict policies, rules and codes helped solve the shortages, calling back to harsh nomadic traditions, suppressed dissent, quashed criminals and while brutal, helped the city grow more grand. Meanwhile, the rebel’s court grew from a few tents, to a keep and a small town, now known as the Silver Hold, attracting its own immigrants and peoples, for now, things were peaceful.",

  "Yet before the Shasu people had come to the oasis, a great ravine had cut through the land, separating Sarkada, the city, from the coast. Inside of it, purple crystals sparkling with energy and sharp as a knife flooded the canyon. Only when the city was settled, did the people begin investigating this odd formation with any effort.",
  "A young mage journeyed towards the ravine one day and started to study the crystals. What he found didn’t blow the world apart, but it did hint at what would come. And before long, another had joined him, then another, and another on top of that. Soon, an entire guild formed around the study of these amazing crystals, it named itself the Academy of Wonders, the wizards within banded together to probe and prod at whatever secrets they could find.",
  "Discovery after discovery came from their study. Refrigeration of food and cooling of buildings, irrigation of the vast farms was simplified, even sanitation of the streets and sewers were now in the grasp of the mages.. The discoveries were so wondrous that the side effects took time to notice. The first mutation is thought to be an old miner, his name lost to the public, who grew an extra tail. Something minor, something peculiar, and nothing that was significant until an origin for what was to come was sought.",
  "What was to come was much greater than an extra tail. Mutations and transformations became more common, twists in who and what people were, in their minds and their bodies both. Soon knowledge of this strange twisting plague was near universal.",
  "The city and the royal guard tried to downplay and hide these corruptive properties, but before long everyone knew about the afflicted. The effects were varied and wide—some turned into half beast, half people, others lost their sanity entirely, still others became the shape shifting legends of lore, werewolves. There were even vampires, mythology springing up around them and becoming commonplace. Powers beyond the comprehension and ability of monster mortal men. ",
  "Not all of the afflicted were fearsome, some were benevolent, a blessed heart, halos and wings, they came to be known as the Blessed rather than the afflicted. These beings radiate calm and care around them, and they’ve become paragons of the city’s way of life, and many sought to join their number and too, ascend beyond mortality.",
  "Still others had little to nothing to show at all. An extra finger, something an odd pattern on their skin or fur, a slightly changed scent. Things that perhaps marked them as different, but not dangerous or remarkable in any major way.",
  "More than just the people were affected, the land too seemed to suffer. In the desert, the cool southernly oceanic winds seemed to be replaced by hot desert gales. In the jungles, monsoon season seemed somehow even harsher, bringing terrible storms and torrential downpours, and in the mountains, the creeping cold seemed even more harsh. The only area seemingly unaffected was that directly around the great rift.",
  "Stranger still, some who arrived seemed confused or lost. Unsure how their ship arrived at this port, how they could have washed up on these shores, confused that the alley they cut through seemed to bring them to a street they had never seen before. While many more rational sorts believe it simply became a common excuse for hiding one’s background by making up a fantastical tale, others believed the crystals seemed to convolute the flow of time and space.",
];

const afflicted = [
  "Laws were passed to manage these growing afflicted. The dreaded ones, the fierce monsters would be banished from its walls, cast out in fear. Those less dramatically affected would, if found out, simply be restricted from living within or owning property in the glorious city. The blessed, of course, were not subject to these restrictions.  Many of those who were less afflicted in their minds and simply desired to live and exist in peace fled to the mountains, protected and supported by the rebel’s hold.",
  "Others, often those not content with a peaceful existence, fled to the jungle, led by a woman from another land with nearly the same affliction as the rest of them. These sort became violent, hateful of what was done to them. Their new leader led strikes against the caravans of the city, attacks against the wall itself, forming an ecoterrorist organization known as the Black Horde that has violence only matched by passion.",
  "Decades of peace finally ended as Princess Aida, a recently exiled royal found herself as the royal of the Silver Hold. With her new knowledge of the suffering of below and despair at the way her former people treated the afflicted, the Silver hold finally decided to take action. The oppression of the people was too great, the abuse of the crystals too pressing and war was the only option.",
  "She sought help from the druids of the mountains, known as the Old Boughs; they were an ancient order that predated her peoples’ arrival. Distraught at what the land had become, they understood her plight and pleas and pledged to aid Aida, joining together with her Silver Hold despite their peaceful ways.",
  "Yet, at the same time, interlopers came.",
  "In the south, the simple port expanded, led by an influx of capital and merchants of the Coalition of the Compass, a mercantile adventurist company, bringing in exotic goods and exporting the strange and mysterious crystals to far-off buyers. Culture flows through this trade route and together with the commune, a service industry has started in the fledgling region, profiting off this new war. Central to this new industry is the bathhouseIt is supplied with food, water--from the commune's aqueduct--exotic spices, perfumes, incense, and textiles from the Coalition's mighty ships. Over time, it grew from a simple house to bathe oneself, to a house of more sultry and promiscuous activity.",
  "Naturally, that close to the city, the Royal Sarkadian Guard patrol and enforce their rules. With the commune working with the monsters in the forest, the guards have all the more reason to raid and nip terroristic activity in the bud.",
  "With all these contenders and players, Permia found itself steeped in conflict.",
];

const welcome = [
  "To the west, the Black Horde strikes out at whatever targets they can find. The terroristic organization hides in the depths of the jungle, always ready to cause issues wherever they can manage.",
  "To the east, Aida’s rebels in their Silver Hold grow their numbers, aided by the ancient magic of the druids of the Old Boughs, they strike out against the Royal Guard and the city of Arkada, and aim to control the ravine and its great crystalline bounty.",
  "In the Northern deserts, the city of Sarkada continues to grow. The Sarkadian Guard continue to defend the great nation, particularly concerned with the interlopers and terrorists of the west and rebels from the east. All the while the Sarkadian Academy of Wonders continues to create wondrous technologies, even the most downtrodden, organized into the ‘royal’ Court of Flies seek to operate from the shadows and manipulate themselves a greater share of power.",
  "In the center of it all,the Coalition of the Compass continues to control the coast, operating its markets and lucrative trade industry. While they bring goods and services from far away, exotic as can be, there are whispers that they only seek to profit from this war and take over the mess that remains at its end.",
  "Welcome to Permia, a powder-keg ready to explode.",
]; 

const newDevelopments = [
  "In the months since strangers flocked to Permia, many things have changed. The founder of the Horde departed the faction, leadership shakeups in the city saw strife within their ranks, and a peaceful handover of power in the Hold opened new horizons for the rebels.",
  "In the mountains, the Old Boughs have fully rekindled their activity, allying with the Hold and stopping the Academy's actions in many instances, proving to be a thorn in their side. The Silver Hold has fully declared war on the Black Horde as well, the conflict escalating from a cold war into one very, very hot.",
  "The Houses have strengthened their guard once more in the city, winning battle after battle and rebuffing a Horde assault on the city. It's not all sunshine and roses, as a few successful raids have dealt blows to both the Houses' captives and the Academy's operations. The Court of Flies has come once more out of the shadows and into the light - at least as much as they wish - and have begun conducting thievery across the realm, offering information on all... for a price.",
  "Finally, the Jungle swarms with Horde, their numbers growing by the day, great rituals and hunts lighting the pyres of the ziggurats once more. While held back for now, the tide only grows and soon it may become overwhelming for the city and the Hold both to contain even working together.",
  "In the jungle, the rumblings of an ancient civilization have stirred once more, and while quelled for now, an evil, civilization-killing spirit can only be checked for so long. History may become the future once more, and quakes across the realm have threatened to show more and more of the once-great power."
