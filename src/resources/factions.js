After all, there is no bad magic - only bad practitioners. By the success borne of this dubious axiom not only has the Academy brought great wealth and fortune to Sarkada as a byproduct of it's own search for power, those of the Academy also consider themselves the best chance Permia has of overcoming the current plague of corruption. This has led them to consider themselves above reproach and become insufferably justified in their actions, for the ends justify the means.",

It was dark, there wasn’t any light to shine onto these poor souls. Food was non-existent in those tunnels, fresh water was scarce, and the people down there grew sick. Leaving the tunnel and venturing out into the heat of the desert would have been considered a death sentence.",

The Queen in Yellow keeps her court close, but her enemies closer, mutants and outcasts flock to her demesne in droves, all under the gleaming streets of the Grand City. All are welcome in her kingdom, provided they bring a skill. Whether that be more overt, the fraudsters, schemers, and liars; or the covert, in thieves, assassins, and thugs. Any drop of wealth that can be extracted from the world above eventually trickles down into the den of organized crime, helping stave off the pangs of hunger a day more.",

The Queen herself never leaves the culverts she calls home, not for many centuries has one been seen in daylight. It is speculated by so-called ‘scholars’ of the court that there have been many Queens throughout the years, perhaps even dynasties within the sewers.
